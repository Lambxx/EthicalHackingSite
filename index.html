          <p>XSS stands for cross-site scripting, a broad category of vulnerabilities focusing on code injection that causes code to run on a target's web application. It is one of the most prolific vulnerabilities on the web, though in recent years, with increased filtering, simple XSS vulnerabilities have been reduced. However, many more complex vulnerabilities are still out there, and the impact can be critical. 
            When your browser loads a web page (like this one ), it performs a request to the server hosting the website at the address you have given, and the server responds with the associated resources for this webpage <a href="references.html">[1]</a>. Generally speaking, this will consist of some HTML (The content of the page), some CSS (The styling for the page), and some JavaScript (This handles dynamic and interactive elements); these are done by your browser locally. XSS aims to inject some code the browser processes (the payload) with the rest of the code and run this on the victim's web browser.

            <p> Reflected XSS uses an HTTP URL (the website address) and corresponding request, which is sent when you request that URL, to inject the payload onto the site. Reflected XSS is called such because the payload is injected on the victim's URL, sent through an HTTP request and immediately reflected through the HTTP response onto the page<a href="/references.html">[2]</a>. It, therefore, requires a victim to inject the payload on their machine, which means reflected XSS usually requires malicious links and social engineering to be effective. For example, a hacker could send a malicious link through a phishing email. When the user clicks the link, the payload that was placed in the URL runs on the site the hacker specified in the link.</p>

            <p>In contrast, stored XSS does not require a victim to pollute their URL, which can make it a more critical vulnerability. Stored XSS relies upon the payload being stored persistently by the web application and sent to victims via a later HTTP request<a href="/references.html">[3]</a>. The script is executed once the payload arrives on the victim's web browser. Suppose a user is on a social media site, and suppose said media site does not have adequate protection, then some user can comment a payload on the website. Doing so causes the payload to be stored in the server/database and displayed to every user who looks at said comment and executes the payload on their browser.

              Both reflected and stored XSS rely on the server passing some payload to the browser; in the case of reflected, it is immediately reflected from the URL, while stored, it is fetched from some persistent location. On the other hand, DOM-based XSS does not rely on the payload passing through the server at all<a href="/references.html">[4]</a>. Instead, DOM-based XSS uses the Javascript document object Model<a href="/references.html">[4]</a>. DOM allows programs to dynamically change the web page's content <a href="/references.html">[5]</a>. DOM-based XSS exploits this by passing a malicious payload through what is referred to as the 'source' to a vulnerable function called a 'sink', which allows execution of the payload(4). You can read about common sinks <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based#:~:text=A%20sink%20is%20a%20potentially,an%20HTML%20sink%20is%20document">here</a>.To give an example, imagine a website, which displays the value you have searched for at the top of the page when you press a button. This search input would be the source; the function that takes the input and displays it without the proper precautions( this is expanded on below) is the sink, and the payload will then execute on the browser.

            <p>Whilst the above two impacts used to be an issue with increased prevention measures recently, this is not so much the case. Whilst these vulnerabilities have reduced, more complex layered issues still exist; CSRF is an example of this. CSRF is a separate vulnerability from XSS; CSRF uses a user being logged in somewhere else to perform actions on behalf of their account. CSRF is protected against using a CSRF token. However, XSS can bypass this. <a href="/references.html">[7]</a> an XSS vulnerability opens the door to another vulnerability.

           Sanitisation involves removing unsafe characters entirely, often by allowing characters that match a safelist or disallowing characters that match a denylist. <a href="/references.html">[10]</a> .
           Escaping involves transforming the input so it is no longer unsafe, for example, adding \ before a " so that it is not read as closing a string but just as text <a href="/references.html">[11]</a>.
           Encoding involves transforming the characters to an equivalent encoded character that is not processed unsafely by the web application; for example, < is encoded as &lt; This is also used when displaying HTML code on a page as a code snippet, so it is not read as HTML, the example html given in the demonstrations is encoded in this way</p>
